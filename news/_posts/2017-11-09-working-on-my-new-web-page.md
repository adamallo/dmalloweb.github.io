Finally, I have put aside some time to work on my web page. As nobody could expect differently from me, instead of spending a couple of hours on strikingly, I am giving a try to [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and creating my own theme from scratch. Time to learn some HTML5 and update my CSS to CSS3! You can find the sources of my web [in my GitHub repository](https://github.com/adamallo/dmalloweb.github.io). I may also distribute my theme independently if I see that it is worth it.
